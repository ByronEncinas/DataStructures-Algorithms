# Data Structures and Algorithms in Several Languages

- LeetCode Solutions
- Dynamic Programming studies
- Backtracking studies
- Sorting Algorithms
- Linked Lists and Binary Tree related code
- Discrete and Fast Fourier Transforms

Working solutions as a practice for a series of advanced courses in 
python. Intentions of expanding into C++ language step on the way, but still on pause.
