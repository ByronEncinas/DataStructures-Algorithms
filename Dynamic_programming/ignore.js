// Here we test javascript code examples

console.log("hello world!!!")

// mixing keys

// if m = 42
// and n = 3

// key = 423 can get into a problem

// better to add separator key = m + ',' + n;

// we are not adding, it is just a way to prevent m,n from being add up}

// DECLARING WITH const in node.js

const greeting = "Say Hi!";

gretting = "Say hello again, change variable value"; // error: Assignment to constant value

//const greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared
