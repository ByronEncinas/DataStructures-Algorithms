Unsorted list, we have to use linar search or sequential search

we have to search the entire list each time, that's why we rather have
a sorted list and use binary search, dividing the list by half each iteration

To understand sorting algorithms we might start with a bad one

"bogo sort" takes a random time to get close to solution

"selection sort" checks up the origin list and compares all values with the
consecutive neighbour getting attention on the overall minimum in that sweep down the
array. Once the minimum in the list is found without a doubt, we append thhis
value to a new list, our return/result list. and delete it from the origin.

now, we have an origin list with N - 1 values, to which we'll have to find 
the new minimum. This iteration will continue until origin has no elements and 
the size of return/result list is N and sorted.
